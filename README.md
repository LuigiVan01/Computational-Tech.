# README for Advance Computational Tech. Assignments

## Assignment 1: Optimization

### Question 1

The task was to develop optimization models to fit a linear equation predicting raw material prices based on the quantity of products sold.

#### Files:

- `quest1_point2.m`: Implements an LP model to minimize the largest absolute deviation and solve the
formed LP problem using the MATLAB function-linprog.
- `quest1_point3.m`: Implements the least squares method to minimize the sum of squared deviations, using the normal equations approach.

### Question 2

The challenge was to maximize the area of a triangular enclosure for chickens, given a fixed length of wire, using the Successive Parabolic Interpolation and Newton's methods.

## Assignment 2: Numerical Linear Algebra

### Problem 1

The code performs adjustments on a signal using components that affect the signal's profile within specified norms. Uses `fmincon` and `linprog` to minimize the 0-norm, 1-norm, and 2-norm of the adjustment vector `x`.

### Problem 2

A detailed report on the application of linear algebra in real-world scenarios.

## Usage

Each script is standalone and can be executed within MATLAB. Ensure all data files such as `A.mat` and `b.mat` are in the MATLAB path or the current directory. 


## Notes

For both the assignments the report is provided.
